# Here comes the Unicorn (or Unicode) 🦄

Hi there! I’m Kohei (pronounced co-hey), an **experienced, multitalented UX engineer** based in Toronto, Canada, who’s been surviving at the intersection of business, design and technology for 20+ years. I love getting my hands dirty to solve real-world problems, make things uncomplicated & modernized, and help people be more productive. 🌟

### What I do

My work spans the full spectrum: from research and design (UX/UI, IA, competitive analysis, web design, poster design) to development (frontend, backend, browser extensions, APIs) to communication (copywriting, technical writing, marketing, DevRel, English-Japanese translation). Think of me as a [ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja) equipped with miscellaneous skills — or simply a **hyper-generalist**. 🥷

### My tech stack

When it comes to web development tech stack, I’m mainly experienced in React, AngularJS, Node.js, Perl, Python and PHP, but most of my projects these days are done with **Svelte**/**SvelteKit**. 

### My projects

Have a look at my current flagship project, [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms), a modern, open source, Git-based headless CMS used by hundreds of individuals and organizations worldwide. It’s a perfect showcase for my problem-solving superpower and the force of UX engineering. 💪

You can also find my previous projects, [BzDeck](https://github.com/bzdeck/bzdeck/wiki), [Bugzilla UX](https://twitter.com/BugzillaUX) and [Firefox Site Compatibility](https://github.com/fxsitecompat), as well as open source contributions to Mozilla [here](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/pulls?q=author:kyoshino) and [there](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/pulls?q=author:kyoshino). I have had an on-and-off relationship with Mozilla, my former employer, since the early 2000s. 🦊

## Fun facts about me

Generalists are rare, but I’m also genetically extremely rare:

### Unbroken voice

- I was a boy soprano.
- My voice didn’t break, so I can still sing mezzo-soprano naturally. If I were a singer, I’d be called a [natural castrato](https://www.google.com/search?as_epq=natural+castrato).
- That said, my voice deepened, giving me a wide vocal range that spans from bass to soprano, plus an anime voice.

### Broken biological clock

- I lost sense of time and stopped aging more than 20 years ago.
- Indeed, I look (less than) half my age. I’m obviously not a teenager or a student 🤣
- I can easily work at night and avoid jet lag because my circadian rhythm is lost forever.
