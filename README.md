# Here comes the Unicorn (or Unicode) ðŸ¦„

Hi there! Iâ€™m Kohei, a UX engineer based in Toronto, Canada, who has long survived at the intersection of business, design and technology. I love getting my hands dirty to solve real-world problems, make things simple, and help people be more productive.

My work ranges from comprehensive UX analysis to copywriting, microinteractions, press/marketing materials development, social media management, web design, UI design, front-end, back-end, code refactoring and Englishâ€“Japanese translation. You might be a little puzzled at this point, but imagine a modern-day ninja equipped with various skills.

When it comes to full-stack web development, Iâ€™m mainly experienced in React, AngularJS, Perl, Python and PHP, but most of my projects these days are done with Svelte/SvelteKit because it saves a lot of time by simplifying the code. Check out my latest open source offering, [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms).

If youâ€™re launching a startup or running a small business, this kind of talent is sure to be helpful. Reach out to me via [email](mailto:kohei@britegrid.io) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koheiyoshino/) today!
