# Here comes the Unicorn (or Unicode) 🦄

Hi there! I’m Kohei (pronounced co-hey), an **experienced, multitalented UX engineer** based in Toronto, Canada, who’s been surviving at the intersection of business, design and technology for 20+ years. I love getting my hands dirty to solve real-world problems, make things uncomplicated & modernized, and help people be more productive. 🌟

My work includes but not limited to competitive analysis, user interviews, surveys, A/B testing, UX/UI audit, information architecture, copywriting, prototyping, microinteractions, UX/UI design, product design, flyer/poster design, web design, frontend/backend web development, browser extension development, code refactoring, API design, DevOps, business development, partner relations, developer relations, marketing material design/development, press release writing/proofreading, technical and non-technical writing, ghostwriting, creative control, speaking engagements, magazine contributions, social media management, SEO, SEM, customer support and English-Japanese translation. 🔥

A little puzzled? Imagine a [ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja) equipped with miscellaneous skills just slipped into the present. Well, you can just call me a **hyper-generalist**. 🥷

When it comes to web development tech stack, I’m mainly experienced in React, AngularJS, Node.js, Perl, Python and PHP, but most of my projects these days are done with **Svelte**/**SvelteKit** because it saves a lot of time by simplifying the code. Have a look at my current public project, [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms), which has been used by hundreds of individuals and organizations worldwide. It’s a perfect showcase for my problem-solving superpower and the force of UX engineering. 💪

You can also find my previous projects, [BzDeck](https://github.com/bzdeck/bzdeck/wiki), [Bugzilla UX](https://twitter.com/BugzillaUX) and [Firefox Site Compatibility](https://github.com/fxsitecompat), as well as open source contributions to Mozilla [here](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/pulls?q=author:kyoshino) and [there](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/pulls?q=author:kyoshino). I have had an on-and-off relationship with Mozilla, my former employer, since the early 2000s. 🦊

## Fun facts about me

Generalists are rare, but I’m also genetically extremely rare:

- I was a boy soprano
- My voice didn’t break, so I can still sing naturally in a female voice. If I were a singer, I’d be called a [natural castrato](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22natural+castrato%22).
- Instead, my [biological clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_clock) broke. I lost sense of time and stopped aging.
- Indeed, I look (less than) half my age. I’m obviously not a teenager or a student 🤣
- I can easily work at night and avoid jet lag because my circadian rhythm is lost forever.

According to Gemini, the odds are one in 100 million, meaning fewer than 100 people in the world have the trait. 🎰
