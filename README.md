# Here comes the Unicorn (or Unicode) 🦄

Hi there! I’m Kohei, a hyper-multitasking UX engineer based in Toronto, Canada, who’s been surviving at the intersection of business, design and technology for 15+ years. I love getting my hands dirty to solve real-world problems, make things uncomplicated, and help people be more productive. 💪

My work includes but not limited to comprehensive UX analysis, information architecture, copywriting, prototyping, microinteractions, UI design, web design, front-end development, back-end development, code refactoring, technical support, developer relations, press/marketing materials development, social media management, SEO/SEM and English-Japanese translation. 🔥

A little puzzled? Imagine a ninja equipped with miscellaneous skills just slipped into the present. 🥷

When it comes to full-stack web development, I’m mainly experienced in React, AngularJS, Perl, Python and PHP, but most of my projects these days are done with Svelte/SvelteKit because it saves a lot of time by simplifying the code. Check out my latest open source offering, [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms), which has quickly earned 100+ stars since its initial release. 🌟

You can also find some of my previous contributions to Mozilla [here](https://twitter.com/BugzillaUX), [here](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/pulls?q=author:kyoshino) and [here](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/pulls?q=author:kyoshino). 🦊

If you’re launching a startup or running a small business, this kind of talent is sure to be helpful. Reach out to me via [email](mailto:kohei@britegrid.io) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koheiyoshino/) today! 👋
