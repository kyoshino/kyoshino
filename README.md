# Here comes the Unicorn (or Unicode) ðŸ¦„

Hi there! Iâ€™m Kohei (pronounced co-hey), an **experienced, multitalented UX engineer** based in Toronto, Canada, whoâ€™s been surviving at the intersection of business, design and technology for 15+ years. I love getting my hands dirty to solve real-world problems, make things uncomplicated & modernized, and help people be more productive. ðŸŒŸ

My work includes but not limited to competitive analysis, user interviews, surveys, A/B testing, UX/UI audit, information architecture, copywriting, prototyping, microinteractions, UX/UI design, product design, flyer/poster design, web design, frontend/backend web development, browser extension development, code refactoring, API design, DevOps, business development, partner relations, developer relations, marketing material design/development, press release writing/proofreading, technical and non-technical writing, ghostwriting, creative control, speaking engagements, magazine contributions, social media management, SEO, SEM, customer support and English-Japanese translation. ðŸ”¥

A little puzzled? Imagine a [ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja) equipped with miscellaneous skills just slipped into the present. Well, you can just call me a **hyper-generalist**. ðŸ¥·

When it comes to web development tech stack, Iâ€™m mainly experienced in React, AngularJS, Node.js, Perl, Python and PHP, but most of my projects these days are done with **Svelte**/**SvelteKit** because it saves a lot of time by simplifying the code. Have a look at my current public project, [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms), which has gained traction quickly since its initial release. Itâ€™s a perfect showcase for my problem-solving superpower and the force of UX engineering. ðŸ’ª

## Fun facts about me

Generalists are rare, but Iâ€™m also genetically rare:

- I was a boy soprano.
- My voice didnâ€™t break, so I can still sing naturally in a female voice. If I were a singer, Iâ€™d be called a [countertenor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countertenor).
- Instead, my [biological clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_clock) broke. I have no sense of day and night. Then I stopped aging.
- Indeed, I look (less than) half my age. Iâ€™m obviously not a teenager or a student ðŸ¤£
