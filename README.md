# Here comes the Unicorn (or Unicode) ðŸ¦„

Hi there! Iâ€™m Kohei (pronounced co-hey), a **hyper-multitasking UX engineer** based in Toronto, Canada, whoâ€™s been surviving at the intersection of business, design and technology for 15+ years. I love getting my hands dirty to solve real-world problems, make things uncomplicated, and help people be more productive. ðŸ’ª

My work includes but not limited to competitive analysis, user interviews, surveys, A/B testing, UX/UI audit, information architecture, copywriting, prototyping, microinteractions, UI design, flyer design, web design, full stack web development, browser extension development, code refactoring, API design, CI/CD management, technical support, developer relations, business development, marketing material design/development, press release writing/proofreading, technical and non-technical writing, ghostwriting, creative control, speaking engagements, magazine contributions, social media management, SEO/SEM and English-Japanese translation. ðŸ”¥

A little puzzled? Imagine a [ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja) equipped with miscellaneous skills just slipped into the present. Well, you can just call me a generalist. ðŸ¥·

When it comes to web dev tech stacks, Iâ€™m mainly experienced in React, AngularJS, Perl, Python and PHP, but most of my projects these days are done with **Svelte**/**SvelteKit** because it saves a lot of time by simplifying the code. Check out my current public project, [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms), which has quickly gained traction since its initial release. ðŸŒŸ

You can also find some of my previous open source contributions to Mozilla [here](https://twitter.com/BugzillaUX), [here](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/pulls?q=author:kyoshino) and [here](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/pulls?q=author:kyoshino). ðŸ¦Š

## Now available for hire!
