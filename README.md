# Here comes the Unicorn (or Unicode) ðŸ¦„

Hi there! Iâ€™m Kohei, a **hyper-multitasking UX engineer** (full-stack web developer + UX/UI designer + marketer + more) based in Toronto, Canada, whoâ€™s been surviving at the intersection of business, design and technology for 15+ years. I love getting my hands dirty to solve real-world problems, make things uncomplicated, and help people be more productive. ðŸ’ª

My work includes but not limited to comprehensive UX analysis, information architecture, copywriting, prototyping, microinteractions, UI design, web design, front-end development, back-end development, code refactoring, technical support, developer relations, press/marketing material development, social media management, SEO/SEM and English-Japanese translation. ðŸ”¥

A little puzzled? Imagine a [ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja) equipped with miscellaneous skills just slipped into the present. Well, Iâ€™m not an assassin, but I also have a rare [countertenor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countertenor) vocal range. Very puzzled? Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m also puzzled. ðŸ¥·

When it comes to web dev tech stacks, Iâ€™m mainly experienced in React, AngularJS, Perl, Python and PHP, but most of my projects these days are done with Svelte/SvelteKit because it saves a lot of time by simplifying the code. Check out my latest open source offering, [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms), which has quickly earned 100+ stars since its initial release. ðŸŒŸ
